# Saarthi
An android application which detects the levels of safety of drivers using real time images for 'smarter and safer cities'. This project is currently maintained under 'Paytm Build for India'.

### Concepts used:

* Convolution Neural Network
* Computer Vision
* Deep Learning

### Description:

The  dataset is classified into 10 levels of distractions using a Convolution Neural Network model.The Trained model is then integrated into the android application using Tensor Flow API.The app takes the images using the inbuilt camera application and the image is sent into the model for classification.The result of classification is displayed in a TextView in the app itself.

### Applications:

* Reduced number of accidents due to distracted drivers.
* Possible assistance during investigations of accidents.
